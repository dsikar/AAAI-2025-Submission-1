The confusion matrix for the CIFAR-10 testing dataset in Figure \ref{fig:cifar10_testing_confusion_matrix}. Examining the testing dataset, the model achieves good classification success, with perfect recognition of 'frog' class. Misclassifications are present but considerably reduced compared to the training dataset, particularly for pairs such as 'truck' and 'automobile', as well as 'cat' and 'dog'. The reduced confusion in the test set is also reflected in the softmax distance to cluster centroid.

Figures \ref{fig:CIFAR10_plot_accuracy_vs_distance_linear_fit} and \ref{fig:mnist_plot_accuracy_vs_distance_linear_fit} suggest how both the trained CNN and ViT models achieves higher predictive accuracy for classes that have lower softmax distance to their respective class centroids, compared to classes for which the models obtain lower predictive accuracy.

% In the context of the MNIST dataset, the derived linear functions from the training and testing data exhibit a negative correlation between the classification accuracy and the mean class distances to the centroids. Specifically, the training data is described by the function $ y = -0.806x + 1.009 $, and the testing data by $ y = -0.677x + 1.004 $. The negative coefficients of the linear terms $ -0.806 $ and $ -0.677 $, respectively) indicate that an increase in the mean distance to the centroid correlates with a decrease in classification accuracy for both datasets.

The scatter plots show the relationship between classification accuracy and mean class distance to the centroid for the CIFAR-10 MNIST dataset. Training data (blue dots) and testing data (green dots) are each fitted with a linear regression line, demonstrating a negative correlation where increased mean distance corresponds to decreased accuracy. For the CNN/MNIST experiment, the steeper slope of the training data fit (-0.806) compared to the testing data fit (-0.677) reflects the greater accuracy and more compact cluster obtained from the correct test predictions compared to the cluster obtained from correct training predictions, noting that both training and testing data use centroids obtained from the correctly classified examples in the training dataset.

These results show an inverse relationship: as the mean distance from the data points in a class to their centroid increases, the propensity for correct classification diminishes. This could be due to the spread of data points within a class â€“ greater distances from the centroid reflect a larger variance within the class, potentially making it more challenging for the classifier to identify the defining characteristics of each class accurately.

The CIFAR-10 linear fit is steeper as can be observed by the y axis values, although it can be argued provides a better fit.

\end{table*}

Table \ref{tab:centroid_distance_overlap_mnist} presents an analysis of the counts and percentages of correctly classified images in the training and testing datasets that have softmax distances to their respective class centroids above a certain threshold. The threshold is determined by the nearest softmax distance to the centroid for the incorrectly classified classes.

The table is divided into two main sections: "Train Data - Train Centroids" and "Test Data - Train Centroids." For each section, the table provides the count of images that satisfy the threshold condition, the total number of images in each class, and the percentage of overlap (i.e., the proportion of images above the threshold relative to the total count).

Looking at the "Train Data - Train Centroids" section, we observe that the overlap percentages are relatively low, ranging from 0.00\% to 0.22\%. This suggests that only a small fraction of the correctly classified training images have softmax distances to their centroids above the threshold set by the incorrectly classified images. The highest overlap is observed for digit class 8, with 12 out of 5,581 images (0.22\%) having distances above the threshold.

Similarly, in the "Test Data - Train Centroids" section, the overlap percentages are even lower, ranging from 0.00\% to 0.11\%. This indicates that the trained model is able to correctly classify the majority of the test images while maintaining a distance to the centroids below the threshold set by the incorrectly classified images. The highest overlap in the test data is observed for digit classes 6 and 8, with 1 out of 941 (0.11\%) and 1 out of 934 (0.11\%) images, respectively, having distances above the threshold.

The Totals summarise the overall counts and overlap percentages across all digit classes. For the training data, 28 out of 59,074 images (0.05\%) have distances above the threshold, while for the test data, only 4 out of 9,838 images (0.04\%) exceed the threshold.

The low overlap percentages indicate that the majority of the correctly classified images are well-separated from the incorrectly classified images in terms of their softmax distances to the centroids. This analysis provides insights into the softmax distance being a proxy to distinguish between between correct and incorrect digit classifications based on the proximity of the images to their respective class centroids in the softmax distance space. The same analysis applies to Table \ref{tab:centroid_distance_overlap}. Most indicative of the consistency of the suggested approach is than both CIFAR-10 and MNIST present an overlap of 0.04\% for correctly classified images at or above threshold. Note we tag the images in the overlap as incorrectly classified, for the sake of assuring that all softmax distances to cluster centroid below threshold are correct classifications.

Figure \ref{fig:MNIST_Softmax_Averages_Training} shows the average softmax probabilities for each digit class (0 to 9) in the MNIST training dataset, separated into correctly classified instances (top row) and incorrectly classified instances (bottom row). The probabilities are displayed on a logarithmic scale. For correctly classified digits, the highest average probability is observed for the corresponding true digit class, indicating strong confidence in the correct predictions. In contrast, for incorrectly classified digits, the average probabilities are more evenly distributed across different digit classes, suggesting lower confidence and potential confusion between similar-looking digits.
Figure \ref{fig:MNIST_Softmax_Averages_Testing} is the corresponding plot for the MNIST testing dataset.
